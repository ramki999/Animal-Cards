			<p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae, and a member of the genus Panthera. It exhibits a pronounced sexual dimorphism; males are larger than females with a typical weight range of 150 to 250 kg (331 to 551 lb) for the former and 120 to 182 kg (265 to 401 lb) for the latter. In addition, male lions have a prominent mane, which is the most recognisable feature of the species. Both sexes have hairy tufts at the end of their tails.
